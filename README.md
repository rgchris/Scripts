Scripts
=======

Library scripts for various flavours of [Rebol](http://rebol.info). Scripts target the following variants:

* [R3C](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/tree/r3c) (upcoming)
* [Rebol 2](http://www.rebol.com/download-core.html)
* [Ren-C](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/) (moving target)
* [Red](https://www.red-lang.org/)
* [Rebol 3 (Alpha)](https://rebolsource.net/) (with a degree of compatibility with [Rebol 3 (Oldes)](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3))

Some effort is made to ensure a degree of consistency where a script exists for multiple variants.

Maintenance of this collection is a personal undertaking and while I strive to meet certain organizational standards, it is subject to other demands on time and attention. Be kind, patient and I hope this is of use to you.
